Task 4: Optimize API Performance
Proposed Optimizations:

Database Indexing: If we were using a database, we would index the ID field for faster lookups.

Caching: Implement response caching for the GET /users endpoint to reduce database hits.

Payload Size: Ensure that the payloads are as small as possible by only sending necessary data.

Code Optimization: Profile the code to find any bottlenecks and optimize them.
